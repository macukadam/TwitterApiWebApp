# Swe573 Project
Hi I am Ugurcan. This repo is for SWE573 term project. It is for learning process of software development step by step with guidence of Dr. Suzan Uskudarli. Eventually I will complete developing a web application using twiter api which is nice. Thank you :)

Update: The aim of the program is to build a web page which uses twitter API for detection certain natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons ect. With constantly listening tweets around the world. The ultimate purpose of the application is to build an early warning system which may save lives of people.

A website which detects earthquakes by just listening tweets around the world is online now. You can create a free account and follow desired locations to get e-mail notification when a disaster happens.
